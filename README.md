# Python 101 Samples
This repository contains basic Python 3 problems with a proposed solution. The programming challenges where took from [**Simple Programming Problems**](https://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html) by [*Adrian Neumann*](https://github.com/adrianN)

## Starting with Python
In order to get and quick and concise introduction to Python Language I recommend the article [**The Ultimate Guide to Python: How to Go From Beginner to Pro**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-ultimate-guide-to-python-from-beginner-to-intermediate-to-pro/) by [*Sharvin Shah*](https://github.com/Sharvin26)

## Getting deeper into Python
As Python is a general purpose language widely used for many purpose having a guide to learning could be hard. For that purpose I recommend the [**Python Learning Paths**](https://realpython.com/learning-paths/) by [*RealPython*](https://realpython.com/team/) as more detailed roadmap to follow for a given development goal.
